# Vaporwave Quotes

Honestly, I can't think of the decent title for this repository so I just name it to the last thing I've done before publishing this.

So...Anyway, I made this repository to play around shooting and blinking stars with CSS 3 and a little bit of JavaScript. Ended up making a mess with my code especially when I add the Windows prompt at the center.

I got insipired after seeing a really cool shooting star SCSS made by this [guy!](https://codepen.io/YusukeNakaya/pen/XyOaBj).

## Stuff Used

HTML, CSS3 & JavaScript
